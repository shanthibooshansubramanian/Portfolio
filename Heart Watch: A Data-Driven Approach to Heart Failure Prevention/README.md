## Data

The dataset used contains 319,795 entries and 18 columns, covering demographic and clinical factors related to heart health.

## Source Data

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Heart Failure Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)

## Model Training and Evaluation

The project utilizes Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest models for heart failure prediction. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Cross-validation and confusion matrices are used to assess model performance.

## Results

The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 97% with high precision and recall scores, demonstrating effective heart failure prediction.

## Future Work

Future enhancements may include:
- Implementing deep learning models for more complex pattern recognition.
- Incorporating real-time data streaming for continuous heart health monitoring.
- Developing a web application for interactive heart health analytics.
