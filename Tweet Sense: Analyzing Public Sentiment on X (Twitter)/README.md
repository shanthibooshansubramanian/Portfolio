# Tweet Sense: Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Using Natural Language Processing

## Project Overview

"Tweet Sense" aims to analyze the sentiment of tweets using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By applying machine learning models, this project identifies the sentiment behind tweetsâ€”whether positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis provides insights into public opinion, brand perception, and trends on social media platforms.

## Python Packages Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- tweepy
- textblob
- vaderSentiment

## Data

The dataset used for this project consists of tweets collected from Twitter. Key features include:
- Tweet text
- User information (e.g., username, follower count)
- Timestamp
- Geolocation (if available)

## Source Data

Tweets were collected using the [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) library, which interacts with the Twitter API. Ensure you have API keys and access tokens to retrieve tweets.

## Results and Evaluation

### Key Findings:
- The sentiment analysis models successfully classified tweets into positive, negative, and neutral categories.
- TextBlob and VADER sentiment analysis libraries provided comparable results, with VADER showing slightly better performance on short, informal text.
- The analysis revealed trends in public sentiment towards specific events or brands.

### Model Performance:
Various models and libraries were evaluated, including TextBlob, VADER, and custom machine learning models. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Work

Future enhancements for this project include:
- Implementing deep learning models such as LSTM or BERT for improved sentiment classification.
- Incorporating additional features such as tweet hashtags and mentions for more nuanced analysis.
- Expanding the dataset to include a wider variety of topics and tweet sources.
