# Tweet Sense: Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Using Natural Language Processing

## Project Overview

"Tweet Sense" aims to analyze the sentiment of tweets using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By applying machine learning models, this project identifies the sentiment behind tweetsâ€”whether positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis provides insights into public opinion, brand perception, and trends on social media platforms.

## Data

The dataset used for this term project can be accessed on Kaggle and includes 74,682 records for training and 1,000 records for validation. Each record represents a tweet categorized into different sentiment classes. The dataset comprises the following key variables:

- Tweet_ID: A unique identifier for each tweet.
- Entity: The source or context of the tweet, such as a game or brand name.
- Sentiment: The sentiment classification of the tweet (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Irrelevant).
- Tweet_content: The actual text of the tweet, which serves as the primary input for sentiment analysis.
  
This dataset includes labeled tweets that will be used for training and validating sentiment analysis models.

## Source Data

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle's Safe Acquifiers Dataset). Ensure you download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory within the project folder.

## Results and Evaluation

The comprehensive evaluation confirmed that the models performed reliably, achieving strong results across all key metrics. This demonstrates their effectiveness in classification tasks and supports their deployment in real-world applications. Continued refinement and enhancement of the models could lead to even better performance, addressing any potential limitations identified during the evaluation.

### Key Findings:
The models achieved impressive performance metrics, including high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. This reflects their strong capability in making accurate predictions and handling various data scenarios effectively. The results highlight the models' robustness and suitability for the intended classification tasks.

### Model Performance:
The models showed high accuracy and precision, strong recall, and balanced F1-scores. Hyperparameter tuning enhanced their effectiveness, demonstrating reliable performance across various data scenarios.

## Future Work

Future work could involve incorporating additional features to enhance model input, experimenting with different hyperparameter settings to optimize performance, and exploring advanced ensemble methods. These steps may lead to improvements in model accuracy and generalization. Additionally, continuous monitoring and updating of the models based on new data and feedback can help maintain their relevance and effectiveness over time.
