# Safeguarding Credit Transactions and Mitigation Risks  

## Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a major issue for organizations, consumers, banks, and merchants, causing financial losses and damaging trust. This project aims to develop a robust system using machine learning and data mining techniques to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. By employing Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models, the system analyzes purchase data to identify inconsistencies and swiftly detect fraud. The project's success is measured by the accuracy of fraud detection, ensuring a reliable solution to this critical problem.

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of simulated credit card transactions from January 2019 to December 2020, covering 1000 customers and 800 merchants.

## Source Data

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)

## Model Training and Evaluation

The project employs Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models for training and evaluation. Model performance is assessed based on accuracy metrics.

## Results

Based on the models trained:

- Logistic Regression Model achieved 92% accuracy.
- Random Forest Classifier achieved 97% accuracy, outperforming the Logistic Regression model.

## Future Work

Future enhancements to the project may include:

- Improving model robustness against imbalanced datasets.
- Implementing real-time fraud detection capabilities.
- Exploring ensemble methods for model improvement.
