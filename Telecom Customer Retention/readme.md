# Churn Shield: Predictive Analytics for Telecom Customer Retention

## Project Overview

In the competitive telecommunications industry, customer churn poses a significant threat to profitability and customer satisfaction. "Churn Shield" leverages machine learning techniques to develop predictive models that identify customers at risk of churning. This enables telecom companies to proactively implement retention strategies, minimize revenue loss, and enhance customer loyalty.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn-shield.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd churn-shield
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the analysis:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Churn_Shield_Analysis.ipynb
    ```

## Codes and Resources Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for developing and documenting the analysis process.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

## Python Packages Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains information about customers, their subscription details, and whether they have churned or not. Key features include:
- Customer demographics (e.g., gender, age, household composition)
- Subscription details (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, payment method)
- Customer interactions (e.g., service calls, complaints)

## Source Data

The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle's Telecom Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/telecom-customer-churn-by-maven-analytics)). Ensure you download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory within the project folder.

## Results and Evaluation

### Key Findings:
- Month-to-month contract customers are more likely to churn compared to those with longer-term contracts.
- There is no strong correlation between monthly charges and churn.
- Payment method and customer interactions play significant roles in predicting churn.

### Model Performance:
Various machine learning models were evaluated, with Gradient Boosting emerging as the most effective, achieving the highest cross-validation accuracy. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Work

Future enhancements for this project include:
- Exploring advanced ensemble techniques and neural networks for improved predictions.
- Incorporating additional data sources, such as customer satisfaction surveys.
- Implementing the predictive model in a production environment and continuously updating it with new data.
