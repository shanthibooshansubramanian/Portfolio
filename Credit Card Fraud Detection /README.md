## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset according to the guidelines in the Data section.
2. Train and evaluate the models as described in Model Training and Evaluation.
3. Analyze the results obtained in Results and plan Future Work accordingly.

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of simulated credit card transactions from January 2019 to December 2020, covering 1000 customers and 800 merchants.

## Source Data

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)

## Model Training and Evaluation

The project employs Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models for training and evaluation. Model performance is assessed based on accuracy metrics.

## Results

Based on the models trained:

- Logistic Regression Model achieved 92% accuracy.
- Random Forest Classifier achieved 97% accuracy, outperforming the Logistic Regression model.

## Future Work

Future enhancements to the project may include:

- Improving model robustness against imbalanced datasets.
- Implementing real-time fraud detection capabilities.
- Exploring ensemble methods for model improvement.
